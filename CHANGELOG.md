If you're using Prism programmatically, this might require some code changes on your side. `getHttpOperationsFromResource` has been removed. [#1009](https://github.com/stoplightio/prism/pull/1009), [#1192](https://github.com/stoplightio/prism/pull/1192)
* **BREAKING**: The `createClientFromOperations` is now exported as `export function` instead of exporting an object. If you're using Prism programmatically, this might require some code changes on your side [#1009](https://github.com/stoplightio/prism/pull/1009)
